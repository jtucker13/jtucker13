- Hi, I’m Josh Tucker @jtucker13
- Currently work as a system administrator(specializing in VDI), solving interesting problems with code when I'm not putting out fires
- I began my programming journey with Java and focused on C++ in college, but my most interesting programs have been built in C#
- I have experience working with:
- Frameworks including .Net Core, Entity Framework, and Android SDK
- Scripting languages including Auto It, Bash, and Powershell
- I’m looking to build my portfolio and take on interesting challenges
